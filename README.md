# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project predicts Tesla's stock prices using various machine learning models. It preprocesses historical stock data, evaluates multiple regression algorithms, and identifies the best model for predicting future prices. The implementation also classifies stock price movements as "Increase" or "Decrease" and visualizes the results.
